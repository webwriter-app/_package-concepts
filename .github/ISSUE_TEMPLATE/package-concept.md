_Package Description_
*Summarize the package idea here*

_Development Process_

**Quality** (https://webwriter.app/docs/widgetquality/):
- [ ] The widgetâ€™s state is restored accurately when reloaded (toggle Source Mode to test).
- [ ] The widget reflects each attribute change (try undo/redo to test).
- [ ] Any interaction with the widget focuses it, and focus is not lost between interactions.
- [ ] The widget maintains the same height when the options are moved to the side toolbox due to viewport resizing.

**Metadata** (https://webwriter.app/docs/packages/configuring/):
- [ ] The package name is as short as possible while still uniquely identifying its purpose.
- [ ] The package has fitting keywords.
- [ ] The package has a short description describing what authors can accomplish with it.

**Deployment** (https://webwriter.app/docs/packages/publishing/):
- [ ] Publish under @webwriter with version ^1
